# 📧 SMS and Email Spam Checker

# 🚀 Overview
echo "This project is a Streamlit web app that detects whether an SMS or email message is spam or not."
echo "It uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of messages to classify new inputs as spam or ham (not spam)."

# 🛠️ Features
echo -e "\nFeatures:"
echo "- Text Classification: Classifies input messages as spam or not spam."
echo "- Machine Learning: Uses the MultinomialNB classifier with TF-IDF vectorization."
echo "- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction."
echo "- Real-time Results: Instant feedback on message classification."
